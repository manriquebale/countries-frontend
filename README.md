# Countries App Frontend

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.0.0.
It serves as the frontend for the Countries application, connecting to a service to retrieve information about countries. The application features a simple user interface with a search input field and a button to initiate queries.
## Key Features

- **Country Search:** Enter a search term in the provided input field and click the "Search" button to retrieve information about countries.

- **Grid Display:** If the service returns results, the information will be displayed in a grid with columns representing the data received from the service.

- **No Results Message:** In case the service doesn't return any results, a message indicating "No results found" will be displayed.


**Install Dependencies:**
